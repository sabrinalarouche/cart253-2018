Instructions:
The goal of the game is to avoid your paddle from colliding with the blue spikes (enemies) which will shrink your paddle. 
While you avoid them, you must try to get the pink triangle to either collide with the disco ball, which will make your paddle grow (the last paddle to touch the triangle will get the bonus) or go off the screen on your opponent's side. 
The last paddle that scores a point will be green and the opposite red.
The winner is the player who gets to 11 points first.
