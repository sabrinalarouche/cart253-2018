Exercise 7
Sabrina Larouche

For this exercise I wanted to explore arrays and making them interactive. I didnt want to make anything too complicated but something I can potentially add onto for my final project.
The array follows the movement of the mouse and changes colour when you left click the mouse.
I also explored the Boid algorithm to keep the balls seperate from each other to not overlap.
Also, explored p5.sound and changing the rate of audio based on mouse movement.

//Variables for exercise
var balls = [];
var mySound;
var previousMouseX;
var previousMouseY;

function preload() {
  mySound = loadSound("assets/sounds/sound.wav");
  for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    balls.push(new Ball(random(0,innerWidth),random(0,innerHeight),0,0,10,2));
  }
}

// setup()
//
function setup() {
    createCanvas(window.innerWidth,window.innerHeight);
    //sound for the exercise
    mySound.setVolume(1);
    mySound.loop();
    //initial value previous mouse position
    previousMouseX = 0;
    previousMouseY = 0;
}

// draw()
//
// Displays black background with array of white balls at random locations
function draw() {
  background(0);
  for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      balls[i].update();
      balls[i].separate(balls);
      balls[i].display();
    }
//Audio effect for exercise
    //Calculating the distance between the mouse's current position and previous position.
    var distance = dist(mouseX,mouseY,previousMouseX,previousMouseY);
    //Changing maping the mouse which changes the rate of sound, faster you move the mouse higher the rate.
    mySound.rate(map(abs(distance),0,50,0,1));
    previousMouseX = mouseX;
    previousMouseY = mouseY;
  }

// Balls change to the same random colour on left click of the mouse
function mousePressed(){
  let c = color(random(255),random(255),random(255));
  for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      balls[i].color = c;
    }
}
